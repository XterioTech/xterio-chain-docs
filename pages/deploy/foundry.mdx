# Foundry

## What is Foundry?

Foundry is a toolset for Ethereum development written in Rust that assists developers in managing dependencies, compiling projects, running tests, deploying contracts, and interacting with blockchains through the command line interface.

Additionally, Foundry can directly communicate with Form's Ethereum API, enabling the use of Foundry to deploy smart contracts into the Form network.

## Getting started

1. Install Foundry
    - Linux or MacOS
        ```
        curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
        foundryup
        ```
    - Windows
        ```
        curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs/ | sh
        cargo install --git https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry foundry-cli anvil --bins --locked
        ```
2. Create a project
    ```
    forge init foundry
    ```
3. Navigate to the Source in the project and create your smart contracts
    ```
    cd src
    touch MyToken.sol
    ```
4. Input your smart contract or use the sample contract below.
    ```
    // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
    // compiler version must be greater than or equal to 0.8.17 and less than 0.9.0
    pragma solidity ^0.8.17;
    
    contract HelloWorld {
        string public greet = "Hello World!";
    }
    ```
5. Install OpenZeppelin contracts as a dependency
    ```
    forge install OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts
    ```
6. Compile contract
    ```
    forge build
    ```

## Deploying Your Smart contract

Deploying a contract with Forge is a simple process that can be done with a single command. However, it requires an RPC endpoint, a private key that has funds, and any arguments for the constructor of the contract.

For example, the `MyToken.sol` contract requires an initial supply of tokens to be specified in its constructor, so the command to deploy it on a network will include the argument of 100.

To deploy the `MyToken.sol` contract, use the command that corresponds to the Form chain's RPC URL while running the `forge create` command:

```
forge create --rpc-url "https://rpc.form.network/http"
--constructor-args 100 \
--private-key YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY \
src/MyToken.sol:MyToken 
```
