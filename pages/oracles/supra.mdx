# Supra

[Supra](https://supraoracles.com/) provides VRF and decentralized oracle price feeds that can be used for onchain and offchain use-cases such as spot and perpetual DEXes, lending protocols, and payments protocols. Supra’s oracle chain and consensus algorithm makes it one of the fastest-to-finality oracle providers, with layer-1 security guarantees. The [pull oracle](https://supraoracles.com/docs/data-feeds/pull-model/) has a sub-second response time. Aside from speed and security, Supra’s rotating node architecture gathers data from 40+ data sources and applies a robust calculation methodology to get the most accurate value.
