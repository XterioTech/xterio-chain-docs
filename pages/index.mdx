# Introducing Form
 
Form is an Ethereum L2 built to advance the SocialFi ecosystem, giving each user the freedom to transact in and across all platforms. The network plans to progressively decentralize itself after its mainnet launch.

Form is a simple way to decentralize and power SocialFi apps with interoperability. We envision SocialFi as a composable ecosystem where online communities can aggregate value and utility across all DeFi, SocialFi and decentralized applications.

Form is a permissionless Layer 2 blockchain powered by the [OP Stack](https://docs.optimism.io/) and secured by Ethereum. The network is incubated by Roll Labs who contribute to Form but do not operate the Form network itself.

The Form network will continue to advance Ethereum through high-speed block times, significantly lower gas fees, native account abstraction and expanding the possibilities of an on-chain world.

Form is building decentralized, composable and censorship-resistant SocialFi. Come build with us. Get in touch with Form [here](https://roll010551.typeform.com/to/WnHWqjAA) to get started.
